3. Extend the processing capabilities in question 2 to a new shape, parallelogram. The
information read from the file in the case of a parallelogram is (p x1 y1 y2 x2 y3 y4),
where (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2 y3) and (x2, y4) are the coordinates of parallelogram.
Hints: Use the principles of inheritance and polymorphism in OOP
